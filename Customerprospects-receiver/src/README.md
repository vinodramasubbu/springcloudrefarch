## Key concepts

This code sample demonstrates how to use Spring Integration for Azure Service Bus to recieve message from a servie bus Queue.

## Getting started

1. Update [application.yaml].

    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        azure:
          servicebus:
            connection-string: [servicebus-namespace-connection-string]
    ```

2. Update `private static final String QUEUE_NAME = "your-queue-name";` your queue name in [CustomerprospectsReceiverController.java]

3. Run the `mvn spring-boot:run` in the root of the code sample to get the app running.

4.  Verify in your appâ€™s logs that a similar message was posted:
